# Out of stock

This extension adds a way of quickly marking menu item, options and whole categories as out of stock (per location).

This is free and doesn't require a license, but you can [donate to Ryan](https://github.com/sponsors/ryanmitchell), the developer behind it, to show your appreciation.

### Installation
Install through the marketplace or upload to extensions in the following folder format:

`extensions/thoughtco/outofstock/`

In the admin user interface enable the extension.


### Stock management
After installation you will have a new listing under "Restaurant" with your menu options, while menus and categories listing will be amended with the ability to mark them as out of stock until closing time, forever, or for any number of hours that you specify in System -> Settings -> Out of stock settings.
